# vellum-csv

This system adds a basic support for reading tables from and writing tables to csv files.

#+BEGIN_SRC common-lisp
  (defparameter *table*
    (vellum:copy-from :csv "~/csv.csv"
                      :includes-header-p t
                      :columns '(a b)))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC common-lisp
  (vellum:copy-to :csv "~/output.csv" *table* )
#+END_SRC

Strings are automaticly converted to values, depending on the :TYPE of the column. Only numbers and strings are supported at this point though. Additional types can be supported by specializing FROM-STRING and TO-STRING generic functions.
